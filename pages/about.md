## About Me

I have over 3 years professional experience developing for XR within Unity for startups in both Madison, WI and the Bay Area. I'm proficient with all aspects of Unity 5.6.3, 2017, 2018, and have professional experience with Blender utilizing the modeling, rigging, and animation functions. My expertise lies in XR interaction systems, inverse-kinematics, and asynchronous mechanisms.  

I love learning new technologies and fixing problems. While fixing bugs and optimizing existing code is enjoyable, what I enjoy most is seeing real world applications of the products I develop. Whether its watching people discover a new medium to socialize with or a new way to treat a chronic condition they've had their whole life, seeing the users find relief and happiness out of my work is best part of being a software engineer.

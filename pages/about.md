## Alec M. Pierce
### Software Engineer in San Francisco, CA  


I have over 3 years professional experience developing for XR within Unity for startups in both Madison, WI and the Bay Area. I have over 6 years of game development experience, with the first 3 being self-taught. I'm proficient with all aspects of Unity 5.6.3, 2017, 2018, and have professional experience with Blender utilizing the modeling, rigging, and animation functions. My expertise lies in XR interaction systems, inverse-kinematics, and asynchronous mechanisms.  

I love learning new technologies and fixing problems. While fixing bugs and optimizing existing code is enjoyable, what I enjoy most is seeing real world applications of the products I develop. Whether its watching people discover a new medium to socialize with or a new way to treat a chronic condition they've had their whole life, seeing the users find relief and happiness out of my work is best part of being a software engineer.  

Like most Software Engineers, I'm really ambitious to start new personal projects outside of my career. That doesn't mean I'll finish them all though...

Also an avid coffee drinker.

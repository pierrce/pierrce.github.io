# Introduction

After discovering Unity in 2015, I've used it for nearly every project I've started since. Starting with simple 2D side-scrollers, I quickly switched over to VR development in 2016 after aquiring an HTC Vive. Since then I've worked on a few handfuls of VR projects that were both professional and past-times. I quickly built my knowledge of the development environment as well as many plugins and assets that go along with it.

# Introduction
Upon starting the creation process of SojournVR, I had little to no experience with Blender. The only modeling/CAD software I had experience with was Solidworks. The transition to Blender
was a little rough at first, but after practicing for months and becoming accustomed to the UI I was finally able to model, rig, animate, create textures and materials, and weight paint within Blender.

## SojournVR

The majority of the models within SojournVR were custom made. Myself and two other individuals created all of the custom meshes used within the game. The main two aspects of the game I focused on included the environment and architecture. All of the buildings were built with components designed
in Blender and later assembled in Unity.

The terrain for the game was created using a generator called World Machine. Using a node-based
system, we were able to properly generate a terrain that had proper mountains, valley, run-off, and
coasts. This was more than enough for our small indie project, and we only used a 64th of the
total terrain generated.

The trees and plants were created using software called Speed Tree. With this software, we were
able to create trees with different Level of Detail (LOD) groups that was necessary for the
performance of our VR world. The software also allowed us to minimize the vertices each plant
had. The end result was an amazing looking and performing environment.

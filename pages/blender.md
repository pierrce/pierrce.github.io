# Introduction
Upon starting the creation process of SojournVR, I had little to no experience with Blender. The only modeling/CAD software I had experience with was Solidworks. The transition to Blender was a little rough at first, but after practicing for months and becoming accustomed to the UI I was finally able to model, rig, animate, create textures and materials, and weight paint within Blender.

## SojournVR

The majority of the models within SojournVR were custom made. Myself and two other individuals created all of the custom meshes used within the game. We created everything from weapons to buildings, characters to environment pieces with Blender.

 These buildings were created with components in Blender and assembled together in Unity. Utilizing the prefab feature of Unity, the individual components turned out pretty good when put together!

## VRChat

After selling the IP of SojournVR, I continued to expand my knowledge of Blender by creating custom models and animations for the popular VR game - [VRChat](https://www.vrchat.net/). I started off just importing existing models and re-rigging them using Blender and the [CATS Blender Plugin](https://catsblenderplugin.com/homepage). 

### CATS Blender Plugin

The CATS Discord server can be found [here.](https://discordapp.com/invite/f8yZGnv) It is a great hub of people that will help each other out with all respects of getting models and avatars ready for VRChat. The Plugin itself is extremely useful for doing simple imports/exports of existing models created with a program called [MikuMikuDance.](https://learnmmd.com/downloads/) I'm not too familiar with this program, however, mdoels that come from here are the most used and requested models on VRChat.

To summarize what CATS does, it allows you to easily import MMD models. These models are very poorly optimized but do come with great visemes and animations. CATS automatically translates the bone, mesh, and viseme names. Reassigns them appropriately, and makes the model easily exportable as an FBX (the file type VRChat requires). It makes it easy to create talking visemes, eye tracking, and do bone parenting if you implement new bones into the avatar but don't really know a lot about weight painting. Its a pretty great plugin for people learning how to create models/avatars that are VR-ready.

Eventually I started developing models and avatars from scratch! The first model I produced this way, and still my most popular to this day, was this little Mothman.

#### I like to believe a Bethesda designer got the idea for this from me.

Aside from creating the mesh for Mothman from scratch, I also added a variety of custom facial animations for him using shape keys. On top of that, I also did all the custom UV unwrapping and texturing using [Paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/download.html) on Windows 10.

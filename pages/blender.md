# Introduction
Upon starting the creation process of SojournVR, I had little to no experience with Blender. The only modeling/CAD software I had experience with was Solidworks. The transition to Blender
was a little rough at first, but after practicing for months and becoming accustomed to the UI I was finally able to model, rig, animate, create textures and materials, and weight paint within Blender.

## SojournVR

The majority of the models within SojournVR were custom made. Myself and two other individuals created all of the custom meshes used within the game. We created everything from weapons to buildings, characters to environment pieces with Blender.

 These buildings were created with components in Blender and assembled together in Unity. Utilizing the prefab feature of Unity, the individual components turned out pretty good when put together!

## VRChat

After selling the IP of SojournVR, I continued to expand my knowledge of Blender by creating custom models and animations for the popular VR game - [VRChat](https://www.vrchat.net/). I started off just importing existing models and re-rigging them using Blender and the CATS Blender Plugin, however, I eventually started making models from scratch! The first model I produced this way, and still my most popular to this day, was this little Mothman.

#### I like to believe a Bethesda designer got the idea for this from me.

Aside from creating the mesh for Mothman from scratch, I also added a variety of custom facial
animations for him using shape keys. On top of that, I also did all the custom UV unwrapping
and texturing using [Paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/download.html) on Windows 10.

# About

Discord is a gaming-oriented communications platform. It is divided up among servers, which are then subdivided into channels. There can be voice channels and text channels that allow its users to communicate in a variety of ways. Over the years, many development communities started adopting the use of Discord. It has a great friends features, and allows seperation between work, questions, QA, and fun!

## Experience

Since the beginning I've supported it by being a member. Being a member allows you to use emoticons from any server you're apart of, upload files larger than 8mb to friends and servers, and have animated profile pictures. Most recently, they implemented a library of games that members get access to. The game selection is actually pretty great! 

Recently I became a member of the hype squad. I've dedicated some of my free time to contribute and promote discord. I'm also invited to help out at discord organized events. The 'team' I'm a part of is called balance. (These don't really matter though because you can change teams at any point.)

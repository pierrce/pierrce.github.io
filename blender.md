# Introduction
Upon starting the creation process of SojournVR, I had little to no experience with Blender. The only modeling/CAD software I had experience with was Solidworks. The transition to Blender
was a little rough at first, but after practicing for months and becoming accustomed to the UI I was finally able to model, rig, animate, create textures and materials, and weight paint within Blender.

## SojournVR

The majority of the models within SojournVR were custom made. Myself and one other individual created all of the custom meshes used within the game. These buildings were created with components create in
Blender and assembled together in Unity.

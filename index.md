# Welcome to my Personal Portfolio

Here is where I will be storing a portfolio of my life's work. I will be putting videos, artwork, screenshots, and examples of everything I've ever worked on within this site. This portfolio will
be a representation of who I am as a person. Like most people, I have a professional side, and a
fun side. This site will be a combination of both. If you would like to see a strictly professional
representation of myself, please visit my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/pierrce)!

While my work is very important to me, I also find it important to share personal matters like hobbies. In the field of game development/design, being able to critically review games and game components is just as important as being able to create them. For this reason, I will also be sharing thoughts and concerns I have for specific games and the video game industry as a whole.

## Current Works

I am currently working on a game called Scape. Its a cyber punk rogue-like using pixel art. You'll have to fight your way through mobs of enemies to escape a reality trying to kill you.

## About

My name is Alec Pierce and I'm from Saint Paul, MN. I have a Computer Sciences Major from the University of Wisconsin -- Madison and have a passion for the video game industry. Ever since I was a kid, I've been interested in video games. Being able to get lost in a good story or grind for a specific achievement within a video game has always held the same merit to me as achieving goals and reading good books in the real world.

Since I was in middle school I always wanted to design games. I started off with creating little scripts and skins for Roblox and messing around with web development. Once I entered high school I started writing Python scripts and getting into 3D modeling through Solid Works. As I entered university, my knowledge of programming took off and in my free time I would constantly be writing mods for the games I enjoyed including: Minecraft, Starbound, Project Zomboid, and Terraria.

While I learned more and more about the industry through creating mods and learning programming through the university, I still played a wide variety of games ranging from shooters to rpgs, mindless clicking games to really hard puzzle games. I gained an immense appreciation for the time and dedication it took to create great stories and games, and during my last year of University I decided to start my own game development studio.

Having picked up a Vive, I became extremely addicted to the VR medium. I fed off this addiction and turned it into motivation for starting my own company. Our first project was an online VR RPG - SojournVR. For a year I spent 40-60hrs/day nearly every day learning how to better model, code, use Unity, create animations, design sounds, and create a world that I was proud of and could share with others. In October of 2017 my fantasy had become a reality and was launched into Early Access onto Steam.

## Experience

Having developed a VR RPG through the Unity platform, I've gained an immense amount of experience. The tools I've used and mastered will be discussed in in-depth on their own pages found below.

After my work on SojournVR, I continued practicing game development by creating custom models,
animations, shaders, textures, and particle effects for VRChat through Unity. This will also be
touched up on in the following pages.
